# Your First Angular Application

## 1. Install Node, NPM and the Angular CLI

- Use the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) or make sure you are using version `6.9.0` or above
- Install NPM (It generally comes with Node, so no worries) 😙
- Install Angular CLI globally
	- `$ npm install @angular/cli -g`

## 2. Verify

Make sure the installation went well by running:

- `$ node -v` -> Version 6.9.0 or above
- `$ npm -v` -> Version 3.0.0 or above
- `$ ng -v`-> Version 1.0.0 or above

## 3. You are ready! Let's create an app

- Create a new application with: 
	- `$ ng new myProject` (it should take a few minutes) ⏰
- Enter your application folder with: 
	- `$ cd myProject`
- Serve your new application in the browser: 
	- `$ ng serve -o`
- If you see: "App Works", **you are done!** 🎉🎉🎉
